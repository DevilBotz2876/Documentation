# 2022 Season minutes

This file contains meeting minutes.  Meeting minutes are meant to help everyone stay informed about what the team is doing. Not everyone can attend every meeting.

## How to write minutes 

There should be a section for every day we meet.  The section title is the date of the meeting in YYYY-MM-DD format. Add new section to the top of the file so users don't have scroll to bottom to find latest minutes.

Write down everything you do at a meeting.  Include things like:
  - decisions made and alternatives considered.  Can include any docs/links that helped make the decision.
  - problems found and if they were solved or not.  Include any useful links/docs found that helped solve the problem.

Write down goals/ideas/plans for next meeting.  That way the people that show next time know what they can work on.  Not everything in the next time list will get done.
